# MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS SPAM SKETCH MENU (1970)

# Background, video (absurdist comedy)

# Objectives
# 1. Work with sequences (multi-line strings and simple lists)
# 2. Perform operations on a "source" string without modifying it (best practice)
# 3. Reassign variables
# 4. Utilize string and list methods
# 5. Count characters, lines, and words
# 6. Use the built-in functions print(), len(), str() and type()
# 7. Encounter various string formatting operations
# 8. Insert line breaks with newline escape character ('\n')

# String and list methods (handy reference)

# List methods: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp

print('\nmenu = ' + menu + '\n') # string concatenation with newline escape character
menu_type = type(menu)
print('object type = ' + str(menu_type) + '\n') # cast type to string

# 2.0 STRING METHODS

# Check if "Spam" is the first word
is_first_word_spam = ''
print(f"is_first_word_spam = {is_first_word_spam}\n")

# Check if "Spam" is the last word
is_last_word_spam = ''
print(f"is_last_word_spam = {is_last_word_spam}\n")

# Switch menu text to lower case
lower_case_menu = ''
print("lower_case = %s\n" % lower_case_menu) # old school placeholder formatting

# Switch only "Spam" to lower case
spam_menu = ''
print("spam_menu = {}\n".format(spam_menu)) # str.format()

# Return character count
char_count = '' # built-in function
print("char_count = {}\n".format(char_count))

# Return line count
line_count = '' # splits on line break
print("line_count = %s\n" % line_count)

# Return list of "words" (punctuation retained)
words = '' # returns list
print("words = {}\n".format(words)) # str.format()

# Drop commas then return word list
words = '' # method chaining
print("words = {}\n".format(words))

# Method chaining order matters
# words = menu.split().replace(',', '') # AttributeError list.replace() doesn't exist
# print(f"words = {words}\n")

# Return word count
word_count = ''
print(f"word_count = {word_count}\n") # formatted string literal (f-string)

# Return "Spam" count
spam_count = menu.count('Spam')
print(f"spam_count = {spam_count}\n")

# Replace Spam with Tofu
tofu_menu = ''
print(f"tofu_menu = {tofu_menu}\n")

# Add trailing " + Spam" and newline ('\n') to each line
tofu_spam_menu = ' ' # str.join()
print(f"tofu_spam_menu = {tofu_spam_menu}\n")

# Split lines and return a list (original menu)
lines = ''

# Return first line by its index position
first_line = '' # zero-based index
print(f"first_line = {first_line}\n")

last_line = '' # negative index; more on this next week
print(f"last_line = {last_line}\n")


# 3.0 LIST METHODS

# Use list assigned to lines variable (see above)
lines = [] # WARN: comment out once lines variable is assigned list above.

# Append 'Red beans and rice + Spam' to list (in-place)
# lines.? # modify in-place before variable reassignment
print(f"new menu = {lines}\n")

# Remove "Lobster Thermidor . . ."" menu item from list (in-place)
# lines.?
print(f"No Lobster Thermidor = {lines}\n")

# Return index position by value
# Get index position: 'Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, baked beans, Spam, Spam, Spam and Spam'
index = ''
print(f"index postion = {index}\n")

# Return element removed ("popped") from list using index variable value
menu_item = '' # returns popped element before removal
print(f"menu item = {menu_item}\n")

# Extend list with another list (in-place)
menu_items = ['Cereal and Yogurt + Spam', 'Eggs, Hash browns, fruit plate + Spam']
# lines.?
print(f"new menu extended = {lines}\n")

# Insert element at index position "1" (in-place)
oatmeal = 'Oatmeal, fruit plate, + Spam'
# lines.?
print(f"Oatmeal added to the menu = {lines}\n")

# Sort the list (in-place)
# lines.? # default alpha sort
print(f"new menu sorted = {lines}\n")


# 4.0 BONUS (Out of scope for SI 506)

# Remove all punctuation using str.translate() & string.punctuation constant

finis = """The End"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~"""
